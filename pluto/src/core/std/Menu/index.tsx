   * Menu.ContextMenu wraps a set of children with a context menu. When the user right
   * clicks within wrapped area, the provided menu will be shown. Menu.ContextMenu should
   * be used in conjunction with the Menu.useContextMenu hook.
   *
   * The rendered menu is provided with a set of keys that represent the HTML IDs of the
   * context target elements. The first target is evaluated by traversing the parents
   * of the element that was right clicked until an element with the class "pluto-context-target"
   * is found. If no such element is found, the right clicked element itself is used as
   * the target. Subsequent targets are found by querying all siblings of the first target
   * that have the "pluto-context-selected" class.
   *
   * @example <caption>Example DOM structure</caption>
   *   <div id="pluto-menu-context__container">
   *    <div className="pluto-context-target" id="1">
   *      <span>
   *        <h2>I was right clicked!</h2>
   *      </span>
   *    </div>
   *    <div className="pluto-context-target pluto-context-selected" id="2">
   *    <div className="pluto-context-target" id="3">
   *   </div>
   *
   * In the above example, the keys provided to the menu would be ["1", "2"].
   *
   * The target resolution logic is ideal for both single and multi-select scenarios,
   * such as lists that have several selected rows that should be acted upon together.
   *
   * @param props - Props for the component. Expects all return values from the
   * useContextMenu hook. All non-hook and unlisted props will be spread to the
   * underlying div component acting as the root element.
   * @param props.menu - The menu to show when the user right clicks.
