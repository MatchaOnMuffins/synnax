This page will show you how to connect to a Synnax cluster using Delta.

## Prerequisites

This page assumes you've already:

1. [Started a Synnax cluster.](/deploy/get-started)
2. [Installed the Delta UI.](/visualize/get-started)

## Adding a New Cluster

Adding a new cluster is as simple as clicking the **Add Cluster** button in the top
right corner of the cluster toolbar and entering your connection parameters, as shown
below.

<Video client:only="react" id="visualize/connect-a-cluster" />

This will add a new cluster to the list and set it as active. Delta continuously monitors
the connection to the cluster and displays it in the bottom right corner of the UI.

### Parameters

<Table
    columns={[
        {
            key: "name",
            name: "Name",
        },
        {
            key: "description",
            name: "Description",
        },
    ]}
    data={[
        {

            description: "A human-readable name for the cluster.",
        },
        {
            name: "Host",
            description: "The hostname or IP address of the cluster.",
        },
        {
            name: "Port",
            description: "The port number of the cluster.",
        },
        {
            name: "Username",
            description: "The username to use when connecting to the cluster.",
        },
        {
            name: "Password",
            description: "The password to use when connecting to the cluster.",
        },
        {
            name: "Secure",
            description:
                "A boolean value indicating whether to use TLS when connecting to the cluster. This parameter only works with secure clusters.",
        },
    ]}
/>

## Switching Clusters

If you have multiple clusters, you can switch between them by double clicking on the
cluster you want to connect to in the cluster toolbar.
