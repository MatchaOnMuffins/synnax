Implementing and maintaining a separate cache pluto side doesn't make
a lot of sense NGL. We need to think about moving the cache entirely to the client
lib. Problem here is how do we deal with streaming. We need to have a better
understanding of what the live write pipeline looks like. This is particularly
relevant for subset data streaming.
